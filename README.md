# Design
 
## Fonts
* Oswald from Google Fonts was chosen due to its distinct and rather "game-like" appearence.
The font is clear and readable, making instructions readable to younger or visually impaired users.
## Icons
* Icons will be used to represent options to the player such as a reset button and volume control, 
universal and intuitive symbols.
## Colours
* A deep shade of red and off white will make up the base of the website. These were chosen due to being 
relatively unintrusive or distracting and an overall pleasant colour scheme.
## Styling
* The sites styling will be done in a way as to attract a users eye to the game, keeping it centered on the screen
at all times.
